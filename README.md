# Build a neural network from scratch

During the Spring of 2023, I built a multi-layer perceptron that performs binary classification equally as well as the scikit-learn
MLPClassifier model. My from-scratch model achieved an AUC score of 0.97 on the scikit-learn make moons dataset.

I implemented methods to perform foward propagation, backpropagation, and gradient descent.

I also evaluated model performance by using grid search and random search, plotting learnign curves and ROC curves, and plotting the decision boundary.
